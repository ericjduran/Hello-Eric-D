Hello ladies and gentlemen!

my name is Eric Duran and my favorite movie is pulp fiction.
i like to eat all types of seafood! why does it have to taste so good?
i would love to travel to japan one day to eat fresh seafood dishes.
i think the reason i love seafood is because i use to go catch my own fish when i was at mexico with my bare hands there use to be a stream of water where fish would just swim through your feet and if you could catch them you culd take them home and eat them.
my favorite animal would have to be dogs because i love how dogs are so friendly and my dogs are really loveable and smart, but any animal can be smart i just love my dogs.
the book that caught my attention throughout the years of being in school was the book called the crossing by Gary Paulsen i read the book when i was in 6th grade and it talks alot about the struggle of mexican boy's life and how he faced obstacles in his life to get across the border at the end. The book made me realize how luck i am to have people that love me and how lucky i am t have education in my life.
One of my hobbies or i shuld say old hobbys was playing soccer in high school, i dont really play much now but id love to get nack t learning cool freestyle tricks like i use to when i was a bit younger.
